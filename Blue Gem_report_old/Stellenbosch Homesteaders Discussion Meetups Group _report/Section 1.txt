I have a vision to buy land in Grabouw and turn it into a homestead. 
What better way to get information on the project than to network. 
Thats why I created this meetup group <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-homesteaders-discussion-group">https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-homesteaders-discussion-group/</a>. 
Please check it out!
This group is for people to discuss homesteading whether it's their own projects or the concept in general.
