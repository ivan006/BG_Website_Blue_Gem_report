Social reality is a complex and multifaceted thing,
Made up of many different entities that we bring.
Organizations, people, processes, places, and objects too,
These are the building blocks that shape our social view.

But what is the nature of this reality we share?
Is it purely physical, or is there something more?
Some say that ultimate truth is mental or spiritual,
While others believe it's found in the material.

Regardless of which path we choose to explore,
It's clear that social reality is something we can't ignore.
It shapes our thoughts and actions, and the way we relate,
And it's an essential part of the human state.
