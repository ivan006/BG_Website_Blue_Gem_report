<li>Only do the watering for the day after all the below is preparation steps are done</li>
<li>Set the mulch aside and weed each plant section (do this after watering as this will soften the soil) (for estimate on effort it will be about 3 min / plant)</li>
<li>Aerate the soil by turning the soil to a depth of half a spade within the plants section but don't go any closer than 10cm to the plants stem. (estimate on effort is about 4min/plant)</li>
<li>Arrange the soil into a slight bowl shape to retain water better</li>
<li>Make a shallow 10cm radius ring around the stem of each plant and fill it with enough chicken manure as per feeding spec.</li>
<li>In the plant section evenly spread enough compost as per feeding spec and keep the bowl shape</li>
<li>Put the mulch back</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps every 4 weeks unless the plants are no longer productive.</li>
<li>Harvest each fruit the moment it has a full flower (if you want you can indeed let your fruits get more mature before harvesting but if you do your plant will take strain and be less productive overall).</li>
<li>Your first big harvest will be 3 weeks into the fruiting phase (estimate on yield is about 0.3kg / plant per week)</li>
